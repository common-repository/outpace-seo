== Description ==

**Outpace SEO**

Utilizing multiple SEO plugins can slow down websites and over-complicate things. We have taken the extra step to consolidate all of the tools an SEO would need to optimize and maintain a website.

**Plugin Features**

Outpace SEO makes sure your site meets the highest technical SEO standards.

**Title Tag:** When it comes to on-page SEO, your title tag is one of the most important HTML elements on a page. The title tag specifies the title of any given web page.

**Meta Description:** Search engines use the meta descriptions to help them determine whether or not a particular web page is relevant to a user’s search query. It is important to make sure your meta descriptions are well-written and accurately describe the content across your site.

**Slug:** Quickly adjust the URL to align with the keywords you are trying to optimize while enhancing your overall SEO strategy.

**Automate Your Alt Text:** Taking the extra step to optimize images is beneficial, but it can also be incredibly time-consuming. It makes no sense why we should have to rename an image and then copy that text over to the alt text. Our plugin automates this process to enhance your SEO and expedite your on-page optimization.

**XML Sitemap:** XML sitemaps are the perfect way to help search engine bots find and index all the important pages on your site. By providing a map of your website, XML sitemaps make it easier for bots to discover and crawl your content. This can be beneficial for SEO, as it helps search engines index your pages more quickly and efficiently.

**HTML Sitemap:** An HTML sitemap is a terrific way to help visitors find the information they are looking for on your website. By providing a list of all the pages on your site in an easy-to-use format, visitors and crawlers can easily find the content they are looking for.

**Header & Footer Scripts:** Implement and organize all of your header and footer scripts into one, easy-to-use plugin.

**Schema Markup:** Manually inserting schema markup (structured data) can be tedious if done manually. Use our plugin to speed up the process by dynamically inserting schema. This ensures everything is implemented properly the first time.

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Outpace SEO, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Outpace SEO” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).
